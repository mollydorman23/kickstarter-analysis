# kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data in order to uncover trends
## Analysis Overview
My analysis of the data available for Kickstarter campaigns focused on filtering for the campaigns that were most relevant to Louises's use-case (ie: producing plays in the US and musicals in the UK). From there, I drilled down to understand which types of campaigns were most or least successful and why that may be. The purpose of the analysis is to give Louise clear takeaways for how she could ensure the success of her fundraising efforts, in order to be able to produce her own theatrical events. 
## Key Observations
1. Theater campaigns from all countries make up the majority of Kickstarter campaigns (34% out of 9 parent categories). Furthermore, theater-related fundraising campaigns have a high success rate (60% succeed vs. 35% that fail). This pattern follows for US + UK campaigns as well.

2. If we drill down into the "Theater" bucket further, we see that "Plays" (Louise's focus), make up a majority of theatre campaigns (74%) and also have a high success rate (61%)

3. Theatre Kickstarter campaigns were most successful when launched in the month of May; campaigns launched in June and July were also more successful than other months. December was the worst month to launch a Theater Kickstarter campaign.

4. The average donation amount for Kickstarters for Plays specifically was $76.38 and the average number of backers was 42, meaning you really only need to source a small amount of quality donations in order to secure enough funding for a play.

5. UK musicals had a median goal of ~4,000 GBP, with a median pledged of only ~1,000 GBP. Lousie's goal of raising 4,000 GBP for a UK musical is unlikely.

6. US Plays had an average goal of $7,178, with a average amount pledged of only $3,685.
7. Longer duration for Kickstarter campaigns does not correlate to a higher success rate. In fact, most successful campaigns only lasted around one month.
## Recommendations
* Theatre campaigns, and plays more specifically, do well on Kickstarter, so Louise should definitely leverage this platform
* Louise should target to launch her campaign in May as a first option and then in June or July as alternative launch dates. She should target to have the campaign live for 1 month, 2 at the most. 
* Louise should work on sourcing specific individuals who are highly engaged in the theater work and are likely to endorse her play. She needs a small amount of backers who are willing to donate $75+ a piece. 
* Louise is unlikely to earn enough from a Kickstarter campaign to fund a musical in the UK. If she really wants to do that type of project, it will likely need to be self funded
* Additionally, she is unlikely to fund a $12,000 play in the US with a Kickstarter campaign alone. She should consider reducing costs for the play and looking for additional funding sources.
