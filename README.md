# kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data in order to uncover trends
## Analysis Overview
My analysis of the data available for Kickstarter campaigns focused on filtering for the campaigns that were most relevant to Louises's use-case (ie: producing plays). From there, I drilled down to understand which types of campaigns were most or least successful and why that may be. The purpose of the analysis is to give Louise clear takeaways for how she could ensure the success of her fundraising efforts, in order to be able to produce her own theatrical events. 
## Key Observations
1. Theater campaigns from all countries make up the majority of Kickstarter campaigns (34% out of 9 parent categories). Furthermore, theater-related fundraising campaigns have a high success rate (60% succeed vs. 35% that fail). This pattern follows for US campaigns as well.

2. If we drill down into the "Theater" bucket further, we see that "Plays" (Louise's focus), make up a majority of theatre campaigns (74%) and also have a high success rate (61%)

3. Theatre Kickstarter campaigns were most successful when launched in the month of May; campaigns launched in June and July were also more successful than other months. December was the worst month to launch a Theater Kickstarter campaign.
